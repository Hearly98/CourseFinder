# CourseFinder
CourseFinder is an open-source web application designed to simplify the process of finding educational courses. Many courses are published monthly as PDFs on different websites, making it time-consuming and hard to search for a specific course.

CourseFinder automates the extraction of course data from PDFs, stores it in a database, and exposes it through a clean API. Users can browse courses in a simple list, filter by location or course name, and plan their learning efficiently.
